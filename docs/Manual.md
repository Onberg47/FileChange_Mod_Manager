# Welcome to the FCMM user-manual!

Need to find out how to do something? This is the place!

<details open>
<summary>Take note:</summary>
The full manual is actually within the program itself in HTML format. This is the original MarkDown version.<br>
Always assume this version is more current as edditing in MD is much easier, so I will make any imidate changes here.<br>
These are also the files from which the HTML version are generated.
